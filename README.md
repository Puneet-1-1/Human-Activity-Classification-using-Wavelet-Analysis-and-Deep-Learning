# Human-Activity-Classification-using-Wavelet-Analysis-and-Deep-Learning
This project classifies human activities (sitting, walking, running) from mobile accelerometer data by transforming signals into scalograms using Wavelet Analysis and classifying them with fine-tuned GoogLeNet and custom CNN architectures, achieving high accuracy.
